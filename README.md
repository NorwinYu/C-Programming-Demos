# UNNC-PGA-CW-2016

This code is my assignment when I was studying **PROGRAMMING AND ALGORITHMS** at **University of Nottingham, Ningbo, CHINA** in 2016 as a second year undergraduate student. Because I was looking for a job to write a resume and backed up my school day code, the code was uploaded and made public on January 27, 2020.

This course is my C language introductory course, and also my enlightenment course in programming. Here I would like to thank the lecturer Paul for this course. The uploaded code is the source code when I learned the C language in 2016. Without modification, there may be defects. This course assignment consists of the following four parts

- Monkeying Around
- Lifting Arrays
- Phone Number Directory
- Dungeon

Part of the code involves student ID, name, and specific server information has been changed, which may affect a small part of reading.
